      <h2>About the Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        The poorest of the poor households are provided food grains (Wheat at ₹2/kg and Rice at ₹3/kg) under this scheme effective from 1st May 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Government of India extended AAY with a target of 5.011 lakh beneficiaries to the State. Priority is given to households headed by widows, terminally ill or disabled persons, those aged 60 or above with no assured means of subsistence or social support, and all Primitive Tribal Households.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further expanded to 4.81 lakh beneficiaries, covering landless agricultural laborers, marginal farmers, rural artisans (potters, weavers, blacksmiths, etc.), and daily-wage earners in informal sectors like rickshaw pullers, fruit sellers, and others in both rural and urban areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third expansion added 5.21 lakh more beneficiaries. A circular issued on 11/09/2009 also prioritized HIV/AIDS and leprosy-affected persons included in BPL lists.
